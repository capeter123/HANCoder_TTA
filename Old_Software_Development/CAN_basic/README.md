CAN_basic

Two boards connected with CAN. One board receives message while the other transmits.

The program is the same for both roles, but the correct subsystem must be uncommented before flashing the program. In order to see transmission and reception of messages simultaneously two different instances of HANTune are needed with each board connected to each instance.

Achievements
 1. Communication via CAN between two boards.
